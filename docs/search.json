    "text": "Hi there! I’m a passionate postdoctoral researcher with a deep love for exploring the fascinating world of plants and their intricate interactions with the environment. My work focuses on understanding how plants respond to challenging conditions like water stress and extreme temperatures, as well as the role microorganisms play in these responses. This area of research is especially important as we seek to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\nI thrive in multidisciplinary settings, combining lab work, bioinformatics, microbiology, and field studies to uncover the secrets of plant resilience. I’m particularly drawn to the power of omics data and its analysis, which allows us to delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms that drive plant and microbe interactions under stress conditions.\nWhen I’m not immersed in research, I love spending quality time with my family and friends, and staying active through sports.\n\n\nUniversity of Burgundy, Dijon | France PhD in Biology | April 2021 - September 2024\nUniversity of Angers| France Master’s Degree in Plant Biology | Sept 2018 - June 2020\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral researcher | Data Scientist | Septembre 2024 - present\nINRAe | PhD Student | April 2021 - September 2024"

    "text": "Hi, I am Corentin and this is my research website!\nMy research aims to understand how plants can better adapt to changes in water availability and rising temperatures throughout their growth cycle. To do this, I’m focus on the study of root structures and their interactions with micro-organisms. My broader aim is to contribute to the development of sustainable agroecosystems capable of withstanding future challenges such as increasing temperatures and drought event frequencies, while optimizing crop yields and soil health.\nGiven the complexity of the relationships between plants and micro-organisms, this research requires innovative and integrative strategies. I use plant phenotyping techniques alongside advanced data analysis tools, including deep learning and omics approaches such as high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics and ionomics. By merging computational methods with cutting-edge biological knowledge, I aim to push the boundaries of plant research and contribute to the creation of resilient agricultural systems.\nI believe in Open Science and the importance of science communication.\nI am currently a post-doctoral student at INRAe (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment) in the UMR Agroécologie in Dijon."
