    "text": "Hi, I am Corentin and this is my research website!\nMy research aims to understand how plants can better adapt to changes in water availability and rising temperatures throughout their growth cycle. To do this, I’m studying root structures and their interactions with micro-organisms. My broader aim is to contribute to the development of sustainable agroecosystems capable of withstanding future challenges such as increasing temperatures and drought event frequencies, while optimizing crop yields and soil health.\nGiven the complexity of the relationships between plants and micro-organisms, this research requires innovative and integrative strategies. I use plant phenotyping techniques alongside advanced data analysis tools, including deep learning and omics approaches such as high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics and ionomics. By merging computational methods with cutting-edge biological knowledge, I aim to push the boundaries of plant research and contribute to the creation of resilient agricultural systems.\nI believe in Open Science and the importance of science communication.\nI am currently a post-doctoral student at INRAE (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment) in the UMR Agroécologie in Dijon."

My work focuses on understanding how plants respond to challenging conditions like water stress and extreme temperatures, as well as the role microorganisms play in these responses. This area of research is especially important as we seek to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\nI thrive in multidisciplinary settings, combining lab work, bioinformatics, microbiology, and field studies to uncover the secrets of plant resilience. I’m particularly drawn to the power of omics data and its analysis, which allows us to delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms that drive plant and microbe interactions under stress conditions.\nWhen I’m not immersed in research, I love spending quality time with my family and friends, and staying active through sports.\n\n\nUniversity of Burgundy, Dijon | France PhD in Biology | April 2021 - September 2024\nUniversity of Angers| France Master’s Degree in Plant Biology | Sept 2018 - June 2020\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral researcher | Data Scientist | Septembre 2024 - present\nINRAe | PhD Student | April 2021 - September 2024"

    "text": "Legumes are grown for their protein-rich seeds, which are used for animal feed or human consumption. Seed legumes do not need nitrogen fertiliser, thanks to their ability to fix atmospheric N2 in symbiosis with soil bacteria (rhizobium) in newly formed root organs called nodules. Legumes therefore play an essential role in the development of more sustainable agriculture and can help mitigate future climate change. However, their sensitivity to environmental stresses, particularly water stress and high temperatures, means that their yields are unstable, which can hamper their development in cropping systems. In the context of climate change, where periods of water stress and high temperatures are more intense and longer, it is necessary to improve the ability of grain legumes to maintain their growth in order to guarantee high levels of productivity. After identifying two soybean genotypes with contrasting root architecture, the two genotypes were placed under control conditions in non-sterile soil and subjected to water deficit and/or heat wave conditions. This thesis highlighted the complex responses of soybean to environmental stresses and revealed several key insights. Water and heat stress significantly influenced the plant’s nutritional balance, with a close correlation observed between water flux intensity and mineral uptake, highlighting the crucial role of water in nutrient transport. The multi-omics approach provided an in-depth understanding of plant metabolism under stress, showing that conditions of combined stress lead to an increase in the potential catabolism and remobilisation of certain nutrient, which is essential for maintaining osmolarity and supporting adaptation to stress. Finally, this research revealed that stress conditions distinctly modify the microbial communities associated with different plant compartments. In particular, root and leaf microbiota responded differently under different stress scenarios, reflecting the nuanced interactions between plants and their associated microbial communities in the face of environmental challenges.\nYou can access the project through this link"
