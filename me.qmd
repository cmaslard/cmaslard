### Hi there !

:::{#hero-heading}

Hi there! I'm a passionate **postdoctoral researcher** with a deep love for exploring the fascinating world of **plants and their intricate interactions with the environment**. My work focuses on understanding how plants respond to challenging conditions like water stress and extreme temperatures, as well as the role **microorganisms** play in these responses. This area of research is especially important as we seek to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

I thrive in **multidisciplinary settings**, combining lab work, bioinformatics, microbiology, and field studies to uncover the secrets of plant resilience. I'm particularly drawn to the power of omics data and its analysis, which allows us to delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms that drive plant and microbe interactions under stress conditions.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in research, I love spending quality time with my family and friends, and staying active through sports.
